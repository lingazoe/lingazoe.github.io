                          The Wine Quality Predictor is a Python project tasked with estimating wine qualities via various machine learning algorithms. Our goal(s) was to determine if <br>
                          wine quality can be determined by their physicochemical characteristics, and seeing if certain factors contributed to low or high wine qualities. This project <br>
                          helped me with improving my Python skills, understanding various machine learning algorithms, and exploring real world scenarios involving data analytics. <br>

      <div class='p2'><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Bionaire+BDF1214CR-CN+Fan+Blade+Replacement/182558"><u>Fast Fix - iFixit</u></a><br><br>
                        The iFixit Fast Fix is a collaborative project tasked with developing instructions for repairing, fixing, or replacing an item that would be useful to others. <br>
                        These instructions are made in the present using photographs and written instructions, helping users to understand the process and apply it themselves.<br><br>
                        This project helped me learn how to properly convey technical concepts to a general audience by simplifying complex repair tasks into straightforward steps<br> people can understand.
                        Additionally, the project enhanced my research, problem solving, time management, and teamwork skills, as this project was done<br> with another person.

                        The iFixit SEO Writing Project involves the process of creating and optimizing information on an existing device page in iFixit. With this, it helps users
                        with<br> understanding devices more easily, and having all the information stored in a single hub. This project helped me learn SEO concepts, improve my research skills, <br>and enhance my writing skills.

      <div class='p2'><a href="https://github.com/lingazoe/marketplace-sim"><u>Marketplace Simulator - Matlab</u></a><br><br>
                        The Marketplace Simulator is a Matlab project tasked with simulating a marketplace like Kijiji or Craigslist. Users have the ability to sell, buy, and search for<br> 
                        items via filters, such as price and location based on individual preference. This project helped me with improving my Matlab and Design skills, as creating the <br>
                        marketplace had multiple components, which involved constant communication with group members so the project would finish on time. It also improved my <br>
                        time management skills, as I had the iFixit projects to complete alongside it.
