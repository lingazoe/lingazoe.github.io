        Hi! My name is Zoe and I'm an undergraduate student at York University, <br>
        majoring in Information Technology - BA Honors. I consider myself a little bit <br>
        of a tech guru, but the nontech side, I occasionally dabble in some community <br>
        work, such as volunteering at summer camps, churches, and elder communities.<br><br>

        Feel free to explore my website to know more about me and my work. <br> <br>

        Thanks for stopping by!
